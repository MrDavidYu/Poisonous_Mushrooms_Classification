# Poisonous_Mushrooms_Classification

In our project, we selected a dataset (hereafter referred to as the Mushroom dataset which categorizes mushroom types as either poisonous or edible based on various attributes such as gill-color, cap-shape and odor) from UCIâ€™s machine learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom. For our KDD techniques, we have decided to use Clustering, Random Forests and Bayesian classifiers.
